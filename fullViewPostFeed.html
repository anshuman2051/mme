                    <p>Several studies have shown that phubbing makes face-to-face interactions less meaningful. A paper just

                        phubbed while viewing a simulated conversation felt more negatively about the interaction than people who
                        didn’t picture phubbing.</p>

                     <p>Whether you know it or not, you’ve been phubbed.</p><br>
                     <p>“Phubbing” — snubbing someone you’re talking to to look at a cell phone
                         — may not be part of your everyday vocabulary, but it’s almost certainly
                         part of your everyday life. Just think about how often a conversation stalls
                         because your friends (or you) have pulled out a phone and descended into an Instagram black hole.</p>
                    <p>
                        The phenomenon may seem like a relatively harmless, if annoying, part of modern life, but research
                        is finding that it may be hurting your relationships. “Ironically, phubbing is meant to connect you,
                        presumably, with someone through social media or texting,” says Emma Seppälä, a psychologist at Stanford
                        and Yale universities and author of the Happiness Track. “But it actually can severely disrupt your present-moment,
                        in-person relationships.”

                    <h2>Phubbing makes you feel less connected</h2>
                    <p>Several studies have shown that phubbing makes face-to-face interactions less meaningful. A paper just
                        published in the Journal of Applied Social Psychology found that even people who imagined they were being
                        phubbed while viewing a simulated conversation felt more negatively about the interaction than people who
                        didn’t picture phubbing. Another, published in Computers in Human Behavior in 2016, found that texting
                        during a conversation made the talk less satisfying for the people having it, compared to people who interacted
                        without phones. A 2012 study even found that the mere presence of a cell phone during a conversation —
                        even if no one was using it — was enough to make people feel less connected to each other</p>
